### About MEXA 
Wellcome and Neuromatch have come together to build a community at the intersection of mental health and artificial intelligence (AI). At MEXA, we believe a diverse and global community can create real solutions for mental health by leveraging generative AI in an evidence-based and thoughtful way. We do this through deep collaboration, learning together, and boundary-pushing research. Join us at [mexa.app](mexa.app).
