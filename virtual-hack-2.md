#### Considerations


#### Guidelines
When designing your project and submitting your materials, it is important to bear in mind the following:

1. **Personal data.** You must not use any personal data throughout the process (both when using any tools provided to you or in your submission materials). Personal data is any information that either identifies an individual or could be used to identify an individual and includes, in particular, live patient data. If you need to use data as part of your project, please use dummy or artificial information instead. 
2. **Confidential and proprietary information.** The goal of the hackathon is to share ideas and build an engaged multi-disciplinary community to tackle the challenge of using generative AI to revolutionize mental health measurement. It will be conducted in an open environment with materials available to external mentors and judges as well as other hackathon participants. You should think carefully when producing materials so you do not include confidential or sensitive information that you would not want others to view or access. If you use any information or materials owned by a third party you must ensure you have the rights to use those for the purpose of the hackathon.
3. **Focus on research, not clinical deployment.** The purpose of this hackathon is to propose possible research avenues and solutions to revolutionize mental health measurement. You must not use any tools (including Google’s technology or products) or submit materials in a way that could be determined to be giving clinical advice or creating a diagnostic tool or other medical device. 
4. **Respect others.** We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:
    - comply with applicable laws, including export control and sanctions laws
    - respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights 
    - comply with any usage standards or rules relating to any content you submit or use in the hackathon, such as the terms of service for any generative AI technology or tools
    - don’t abuse or harm others, yourself, or any services (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying or harassing others or generating or sharing malware
